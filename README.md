<H1>UserAuth : WEB_Application</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Privacy is integral part of Human being . It influences human behaviour 
The Part of Privacy is crucial in Internet as well, to get rid of Unautherised access<br> 
is major aim of the Web Security , Understanding needs of this scenario. We have Devloped 
UserAuth , A partial Web Application which can submerge <br> with all other WebApplication those use
user Personal Profile for ease of Access. UserAuth helps with the secure Authentication features .
UserAuth Provides Robust privacy. this application helps priacy with the implementation of the Hashing alorithms 
those cannot be decrypted , which means even the developers of WebApplication will not have the exact information 
about the profile .<br>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Real time Authentication</li>
<li> Robust Security for the Password</li>
<li> Secure Hashing for User Info</li>
<li> GMail API Integration for Account Recovery</li>
</ul>
<b> Project Title</b>:- User Authentication Application <br><br>
<b>Abstract</b> :- The project aims to develop a Dynamic Web Application to handle secure
connections for user application accounts. The application follows a layered
architecture for user authentication, incorporating HASH ID verification and email
authentication systems. With a focus on robustness, the project will be developed
using the Java Spring Framework and Google Mail API. The project environment will
utilize the Maven architecture for structured development and maintenance.<br><br>

<h3>Functional Requirements:</h3><br>

<b>User Authentication:</b><br>

Users should be able to register and log in securely using their credentials.<br>
Authentication should be real-time and provide immediate feedback to users.<br><br>

<b>Robust Security for Passwords:</b><br><br>

Passwords should be securely stored using hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to prevent unauthorized access.<br><br>

<b>Secure Hashing for User Info:</b><br>

User information should be hashed securely and stored in the database to protect privacy.<br>
Hashed information should be irreversible, ensuring that even developers cannot decrypt user data.<br><br>

<br>Gmail API Integration for Account Recovery:</b><br>

Users should have the option to recover their accounts using the Gmail API.<br>
Account recovery process should be secure and user-friendly.<br><br>

<h3>Non-Functional Requirements:</h3><br><br>

<b>Performance:</b><br>
The application should handle multiple concurrent user requests efficiently.<br>
Response times should be minimal to provide a smooth user experience.<br><br>

<b>Security:</b><br>

The application should adhere to industry-standard security practices to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.<br>
Hashing algorithms should be resistant to brute-force attacks and other cryptographic attacks.<br><br>

<b>Scalability:</b><br>

The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate an increasing number of users and data.<br>
The architecture should support adding more servers or resources without significant downtime or performance degradation.<br><br>

<b>Reliability:</b><br>

The application should be reliable and available 24/7, with minimal downtime for maintenance or upgrades.<br>
Data integrity should be maintained even during server failures or system crashes.<br><br>
